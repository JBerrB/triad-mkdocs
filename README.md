# triad-mkdocs
Using Docker to encapsulate Mkdocs to produce and serve a website

USAGE
mkdockerize.sh produce
Generates a site.tar.gz file inside output that contains the website generated by Mkdocs

mkdockerize.sh serve
Injects input/site.tar.gz and serves the website in port 8000. Access to it via http://127.0.0.1:8000


DESIGN
mkdockerize.sh -> script that allows options ‘produce’ and ‘serve’ to generate or serve the docs website
mkdocs -> 
	* Dockerfile: Generates an ubuntu image with Mkdocs binaries installed. Also sets is with an specific configuration to be built/served
	* files/entrypoint.sh: Allows to use image to both produce a website or serve it
	* files/mkdocs.yml: Mkdocs YAML document to generate docs website
README.md -> explaining usage and design
.gitignore -> gitignore file to ignore input and output folders created for volumes


NOTES
The Mkdocs image is built this way:
docker build --build-arg PROJECT_NAME=tri-ad -t mkdocs .

To input/output data into and from the Mkdocs container, I’m using local volumes bound to the /tmp folder inside the container 
* produce
docker run -d -v ${PWD}/output:/tmp mkdocs produce

* serve
docker run -p 8000:8000 -d -v ${PWD}/input:/tmp mkdocs serve
